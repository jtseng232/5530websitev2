# 5530websitev2
Why this exists: Because version 1 died and making things undead is difficult and not fun.
The goal of this is to make a new website to represent FRC Team 5530, and make some serious improvments to the original design while we're at it.
The project is mainly written in html, but other programming languages will come in if necessary.
The main goal is to restore the basic structure of the original website, including a full blog to keep updates ready if necessary.
The only difference is that the media center will be eliminated, and likely replaced with a more adequate image host (such as Flickr).
